# AI Image Authentication System

A forensic tool for detecting AI-generated imagery using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

---

## 🚀 Features

- **AI Detection**: Accurately classifies images as "REAL" or "AI GENERATED"
- **Forensic Reports**: Generates a downloadable PDF datasheet for every analysis
- **Modern UI**: Sleek, high-tech interface with orange accents and Rajdhani typography
- **Optimized**: Supports CUDA acceleration and Mixed Precision training

---

## 🛠 Setup

### 1. Requirements

Install the necessary Python packages:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision gradio fpdf datasets tqdm Pillow
```

### 2. Model Weights

Ensure your trained model file `model_epoch_10.pth` is located in the project root directory.

### 3. Running the App

Launch the web interface:
```bash
python main.py
```

## 🧠 Architecture

The system utilizes a custom 5-Layer CNN designed specifically to identify the frequency artifacts found in synthetic media.

- **Input**: 224x224 RGB
- **Features**: 5 blocks (Conv2D → ReLU → BatchNorm → MaxPool)
- **Output**: Sigmoid (0 = AI, 1 = Real)
